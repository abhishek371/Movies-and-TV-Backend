Broadcast between 1990 and 1995 on BBC One, the sitcom spawned five series and 44 episodes\u20144 of which are Christmas specials. Keeping Up Appearances was a great success in the UK and also captivated a large audience in the US, Canada, and Australia, but production ceased in 1995 when Routledge wanted to move on to other projects. Since its original release, all five series\u2014including Christmas specials\u2014are available on DVD. In 2004, the sitcom was ranked 12th in the countdown of Britain's Best Sitcom.
